# Sentiment Analysis for Google Play Store Reviews

A Streamlit-based web application that performs **sentiment analysis on Google Play Store reviews** using a machine learning model trained on real user reviews of the **DANA e-wallet app**.

Built with simplicity, Indonesian language support, and practicality in mind.

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Predicts sentiment as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**  
- **Play Store Integration**: Automatically scrapes reviews using **App ID** or **Play Store URL**  
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clean and intuitive Streamlit interface in **Bahasa Indonesia**  
- **On-Demand Model Training**: Trains an SVM model automatically if no model exists  
- **Interactive Visualization**: Pie chart showing sentiment distribution  
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts both raw App ID (e.g., `id.dana`) and full Play Store links  
- **Custom Review Limit**: Choose how many reviews to analyze (10–200)

## Tech Stack

| Component         | Technology |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Framework**     | Streamlit |
| **ML Model**      | SVM + TF-IDF |
| **Preprocessing** | NLTK (Indonesian stopwords), regex |

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:  
  `streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `google-play-scraper`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure you have `datasetdana.csv` in the root directory — it contains the labeled training data.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Install required packages  
3. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

5. **Enter**:
   - App ID (e.g., `id.dana.danabijak`)  
   - **OR** full Play Store URL  
   - Choose number of reviews (10–200)  
   - Click **"Analisis Sentimen"**

6. View results: table + pie chart + summary!

## Output

After analysis, you’ll see:
- A **data table** of all processed reviews with predicted sentiment labels  
- A **pie chart** visualizing sentiment distribution  
- A **summary card** showing counts:  
  `Positif | Netral | Negatif`

---

## Technical Details

- **Model**: `SVM (Support Vector Machine)` with `TF-IDF` vectorization  
- **Training Data**: `datasetdana.csv` (500+ real user reviews, manually labeled into 3 classes)  
- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Lowercasing
  - Remove special characters & numbers
  - Filter Indonesian stopwords (`nltk`)
- **Scraping**: Uses official Play Store API via `google-play-scraper` (no Play Store login needed)

> **Note**: The model is optimized for financial/e-wallet apps like DANA. Accuracy may vary for apps in other domains.
